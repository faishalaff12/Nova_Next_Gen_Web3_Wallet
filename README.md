## 🎯 The Objective
In the fast-paced Web3 and SaaS industry, capturing early adopters is critical. The goal of this MVP (Minimum Viable Product) landing page is to act as a high-converting "Lead Machine." It convinces visitors to trade their email addresses for early access using a cyberpunk-inspired, modern UI.

* **Custom CSS Grid:** A purely code-based background pattern (no heavy images) to maintain lightning-fast load times.
